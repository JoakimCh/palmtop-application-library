# Palmtop Application Library

Do you own one of the old Hewlett Packard Palmtops, the ones running MS-DOS 5.0? Namely the HP 100LX or the HP 200LX, and do you want to develop software for them?

Then this site is for you!

"PAL lets programmers create DOS programs for the Palmtop with the look and feel of a built-in Palmtop application"

Here I will host a copy of the community driven PAL library which was created to ease software development for these cool old devices. The copy put here is the latest version found on the internet, version 1.6 and this place will now accept further development of the PAL library, anyone is free to contribute!

The (currently original) PAL library can be found in the directory of the same name. But I have also added other directories where I will place other relevant tools and documentation. For example old but still available compilers that can compile the PAL library and make executables which will work on the devices.

Currently the best way to get started is to use DOSEMU:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOSEMU
And then install the Turbo C compiler and set it up so it can compile PAL, I will share a guide for this at some point.

To test out the compiled programs in the same emulator one can use the INT5f tool found in the "tools and compilers" directory.
