What is SCUTILS

   SCUTILS is a small utility that makes use of the  PAL Software
   Carousel API to provide numerous ways of manipulating the Software
   Carousel program. If you are not familiar with Software Carousel,
   it is an excellent task-switching program product sold by Sunshine
   Software Company

   It allows you to have Multiple DOS sessions on your HPx00LX and
   switch easily between them. SCUtils intention is to provide an
   alternate method of working with Software Carousel. SCUTils makes
   extensive use of the SC module from the PAL Software Library.


What is the SCUTILS Syntax

   SCUtils is meant to be invoked from the DOS command line or from a
   batch file. All input is from the command line via switches and all
   output is to the screen. Output could be redirected.

   All switches should be prefixed with either the "/" symbol or the
   "-" symbol. Multiple commands may be issued at once but each should
   be prefixed separately.

   OK:  SCUTILS -z1 -Z2,400 "-N2,NEW NAME"

   BAD: SCUTILS -z1Z2,400 -N2,NEW NAME

   As well as switches having to be separate, when a switch requires
   One argument to must be adjacent to the switch (-z1 not -z 1). If a
   switch requires two parameters they are separated by a single Comma
   ",". If a switch requires a string and the string has a blank in it
   the entire switch must be wrapped in quotes (see example above).

What Functions are Available

   Reboot Computer                          -b

      This command permits your program to boot the system, removing
      Carousel and all other software from memory. This command will
      always be the last executed if a series of switches are given.


   Send String to Session number            "-csession,command"

      To send keystrokes to another Work Area. This switch takes two
      parameters. The first is the session and the second is the
      string to send. Only one string can be sent to a session before
      you switch to it.


   Get where code is running                -C

      This switch is informational only. It prints a message
      displaying a number which represents a bitmap of info.

	    bit 0 on = Carousel is running in Extended Memory
	    bit 1 on = Carousel is running in Expanded Memory
	    bit 2 on = Carousel is storing code in Expanded Mem
	    bit 3 on = Carousel is storing code in Extended Mem
	    bit 4 on = Carousel is storing code on disk.


   Show the help screen                    -h|-H|-?

      Any of these three switches will show the quick reference
      screen.


   Kill program in Session number           -ksession

      To command Carousel to KILL the program running in a specified
      Work Area.  Note: This options also removes any TSR programs
      loaded in the Work Area being killed. This switch takes a single
      parameter, the session


   Set/Get Key switch status                -Ktype

      To control the operator's ability to use Carousel keyboard
      commands;  to invoke the menu or switch to another Work Area.
      This switch takes a single parameter which is interpreted as
      follows;


              0 =  disable keyboard
              1 =  enable keyboard
              2 =  disable keyboard during AUTO-START
              3 =  get present status

      This switch will always print a string telling you what the
      present status is.

      0 =  keyboard is disabled
      1 =  keyboard is enabled
      2 =  keyboard is disabled until AUTO-START finishes




   Invoke SC Menu                           -m

      To display and activate the Carousel Control Menu from within
      your program. This switch takes no parameters.

   Get Session Name                         -nsession

      To obtain the (menu) name of the Work Area specified. This
      switch takes one parameter and will display the sessions name.



   Set Session numbers Name to string       "-Nsession,string"

      To update the (menu) name of the Work Area specified. This
      switch takes two parameters, a session number and the new name
      for that session.


   Determine if SC is Present               -p

      This command determines whether or not Software Carousel is
      running.  If Software Carousel is running, this command returns
      the version number of Software Carousel.



   Quit SC with(0) or without(1) prompting  -qtype

      To cause the Software Carousel Program to exit.  Use with
      caution as in-process information in Work Areas will not be
      saved or updated. This switch takes a single parameter, type. If
      type is 0 then SC will present the user with an "are you sure"
      message before quitting. If type is 1 SC will just quit.


   Switch to Session number                 -ssession

      To command Carousel to switch to a different Work Area. This
      switch take the session number as its parameter and will

      the version number of Software Carousel.




   Get Session numbers Size                 -zsession

      To return to your program the size of the Work Area specified.
      This switch takes the session of interest as a parameter and
      returns that sessions size in kbytes.


   Set Session number1s Size to number2     -Zsession,size

      To return to your program the size of the Work Area specified.
      This switch takes the session of interest and a new size as
      parameters and sets that sessions size in kbytes.
