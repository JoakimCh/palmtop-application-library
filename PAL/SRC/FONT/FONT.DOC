^u Unified font routines

The unified font routines permit transparent usage of both the built-in
fonts and the loadable fonts that the HFN module supports. A font is
always identified by an integer with the unified font routines -
regardless whether it is a built-in or a loadable font.

A number of loadable fonts are provided with PAL - they have the '.HFN'
file extension. (Check the .\UTIL\HFN directory)

Available functions:

  - TextOut     : Output a string at (x,y) in a font you specify.
  - TextExt     : Compute the pixel length of a string in a given font.
  - FontHeight  : Returns the height of a given font in pixels.
  - LoadFont    : Load a font file by name.
  - DiscardFont : Discard a font loaded by LoadFont.


Note that TextOut, TextExt and TextHeight actually are pointers
to functions, not functions. You can transparently call them if
they were functions though. (If your C compiler is ANSI
compatible).

The reason for this device is space efficiency. Even if you use
the 'unified' font functions, proportional font support is only
drawn into your application if you call LoadFont somewhere.
Otherwise, using the .\FONT module adds only very little
overhead over using the lowlevel output routine WriteText (from
the LOGRAPH module). In this way, your application can be
'proportional font-enabled' without having to pay a large price
for it. The additional overhead is about 100 bytes that are
added to the size of your application for using the 'unified'
functions instead of directly using WriteText. Should you
require loadable fonts later, you can simply add a "LoadFont"
somewhere, and use the integer that it returns with your old
code. (At this moment, your code size will increase by a few K
because proportional font support is added.)

!short: TextOut              Write a text string at a given position
   NAME
      TextOut

   DESCRIPTION
      TextOut outputs a text string at a given screen position, with
      a style and font you specify.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int TextOut(int x, int y, int Style, int FntId, char *s);

   INPUTS
      x, y   - the output position on the screen
      Style  - one of the following output rules:
               FORCE_RULE,  AND_RULE,    OR_RULE,
               XOR_RULE, INVFOR_RULE, INVAND_RULE,
               INVOR_RULE,  INVXOR_RULE, TXT_RULE
               (See the PutImg documentation for more info on these)
      FntId  - a font id - either one of the constants SMALL_FONT,
               MEDIUM_FONT, LARGE_FONT (for built-in fonts), or an integer
               returned by LoadFont.
      s      - the string to be output

   RETURN VALUE
      Returns the length of the string (in pixels), or 0 on error.

   NOTE
      Note that TextOut is not a function, but a pointer to a function,
      also see the general remarks at the start of this modules
      description. (Under 'Unified font routines')

   SAMPLE
      TextOut(10, 10, TXT_RULE, LARGE_FONT, "Hello PAL !");

   NAME
      TextExt

   DESCRIPTION
     Returns the length (in pixels) of the string s on the display, if
     a given font would be used to display it. The font (specified by
     an integer id) can be a proportional font as loaded by LoadFont, or a
     built-in one.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int TextExt(int FntId, char *s);

   INPUTS
      FntId  - a font id - either one of the constants SMALL_FONT,
               MEDIUM_FONT, LARGE_FONT (for built-in fonts), or an integer
               returned by LoadFont.
      s      - the string that you want to compute the length of.

   RETURN VALUE
      Returns the length of the string (in pixels), or 0 on error.

      PosX = (MAX_X - Len)/2; /* center string horizontally */
      TextOut(PosX, 10, TXT_RULE, LARGE_FONT, Welcome); /* display it */

      or a built-in font.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int FontHeight(int FntId);

   INPUTS
      FntId  - a font id - either one of the constants SMALL_FONT,
               MEDIUM_FONT, LARGE_FONT (for built-in fonts), or an integer

!short: LoadFont             Load a proportional font from file or memory
   NAME
      LoadFont
   DESCRIPTION
      loads a proportional font, returns an integer that identifies the
      font. (A font 'handle', if you prefer). An additional parameter
      permits initialization of 'resident' fonts that are already in
      memory.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int LoadFont(void *Font, int Resident);

   INPUTS
      Font     - a pointer to either a font name (usually the case), or to
                 the binary image of a resident font.
      Resident - If your font doesn't reside in a file, but is contained
                 in your application (as a binary image of the file in an
                 initialized array), pass a pointer to the image as the
                 'Font' parameter, and pass 1 as the 'Resident' flag.
                 Also see the documentation of the MKBIN utility for
                 information on how to create binary images of files
                 for inclusion in a C program.
                 Otherwise, pass 0 here.

   RETURN VALUE
      Returns an integer that identifies the font - store it and use it to
      refer to the font in other functions of this module like TextOut,
      TextExt, DiscardFont ...

   NOTE
      Note that a call to LoadFont will actually draw in proportional font
      support into your application. LoadFont always returns negative Ids
      or zero to indicate an error. This is to be able to differ from
      the built-in font Ids which are always positive. Your application
      can handle both types of ids exactly in the same way, though - the
      differentiation is handled inside of the unified font routines.
      That's what the reason why they exist in the first place, actually.

   SAMPLE
      int PosX;
      int PosY;
      int Len;
      int Height;
      int FontId;
      char *Welcome = "Hello PAL !;

      FontId = LoadFont("SPAB0015.HFN", 0);
      if(FontId == 0) FatalExit("Loading font failed !", 1);

      Len    = TextExt(FontId, Welcome); /* get length of string */
      Height = FontHeight(FontId);
      PosX = (MAX_X - Len)/2;    /* center string horizontally */
      PosY = (MAX_Y - Height)/2; /* center string vertically   */
      TextOut(PosX, PosY, TXT_RULE, FontId, Welcome); /* display it */

!short: DiscardFont          Discard a loadable font, recovering its memory
   NAME
      DiscardFont
   DESCRIPTION
      Throws away a font, recovering the memory associated with it.
      Attempts to discard built-in or resident fonts are simply ignored.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void DiscardFont(int FntId);

   INPUTS
      FntId  - a font id - either one of the constants SMALL_FONT,
               MEDIUM_FONT, LARGE_FONT (for built-in fonts), or an integer
               returned by LoadFont.

   NOTE
      DiscardFont simply ignores attempts to discard a built-in font
      (constants SMALL_FONT, MEDIUM_FONT, LARGE_FONT) or a resident font
      (one which is contained as a binary image in your application, see
      the description of the 'Resident' parameter in the LoadFont function
      for details).

   SAMPLE
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <stdlib.h>

      #include "pal.h"

      int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
      {
         int PosX;
         int PosY;
         int Len;
         int Height;
         int FontId;
         char *Welcome = "Hello PAL !;

         if(argc != 0)  FatalExit("Must specify font to load", 1);
         if(!PalInit(1)) FatalExit("PalInit failed", 1);

         FontId = LoadFont(argv[1], 0);
         if(FontId == 0) FatalExit("Loading font failed !", 1);

         Len    = TextExt(FontId, Welcome); /* get length of string */
         Height = FontHeight(FontId);
         PosX = (MAX_X - Len)/2;    /* center string horizontally */
         PosY = (MAX_Y - Height)/2; /* center string vertically   */
         TextOut(PosX, PosY, TXT_RULE, FontId, Welcome); /* display it */
         GetKey();
         DiscardFont(FontId);
         PalDeinit(1);
         return 0;
