^u Alternate memory management routines

The alternate memory management routines are used in PAL to provide
a way to handle out-of memory conditions.

Available functions:

  - PalMalloc       : Malloc replacement with out-of-mem handling
  - PalRealloc      : Realloc replacement with out-of-mem handling
  - PalCalloc       : Calloc replacement with out-of-mem handling
  - PalFree         : Free replacement
  - PalStrdup       : Strdup replacement with out-of-mem handling
  - SetPalMemFail   : Define your own out-of memory handler

!short: MEM Introduction
When a request for memory is made inside PAL and an out of
memory situation results, an error handling routine is called.

This routine, by default, does a FatalExit. You can instruct PAL
to call a routine of your own when an out-of-mem condition
happens though. And you can of course also use these routines in
your own programs, in a variety of ways.

There are several levels at which you can use these functions in
your own program.

Level 0: just leave them alone - they will do their work for you
         inside PAL, but you can continue to use the classic
         C library routines malloc, calloc, free etc.

Level 1: Use just the out-of-memory handler. For example, your
         application may have important files open which you
         want to flush prior to exiting, should an out-of-mem
         condition arise in PAL. You can even try to free some
         memory that you know can be discarded and tell the
         calling function to try the allocation again.

Level 2: Use them explicitly. That is, you make calls to the
         replacement routines PalMalloc, PalRealloc, PalFree etc,
         instead of the ones from the standard lib. You should
         use the new routines consistently - for example, if you
         allocate memory using PalMalloc, you should free it with
         PalFree.

Level 3: Use them implicitly. To do this, just #include "palmem.h"
         in your application. (Put it after the pal.h include).
         This will activate a set of #defines that change the
         standard C library memory allocation calls (malloc, calloc,
         realloc etc.) into the corresponding PAL versions. You
         will not need to search-and-replace through your existing
         source code if you want to switch to the PAL routines.
         You _will_ need to recompile your source though. If you
         dislike the 'behind-the-screens' way in which macros
         work, use Level 2 instead of this level. Both Level 2
         and Level 3 can be combined with the use of the
         out-of-memory handler.

!short: PalMalloc            Replacement for malloc
   NAME
      PalMalloc

   DESCRIPTION
      Allocates memory like malloc does, but will call the
      out-of-mem handler when it can't allocate the requested
      block.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void *PalMalloc(size_t size);

   INPUTS
      size - the amount of memory (in bytes) to allocate.

   RETURN VALUE
      A pointer to the allocated block of memory. If the
      allocation fails, PalMalloc will call the PalMemFail
      function with the size of the requested block. The
      standard PalMemFail will simply do a FatalExit, but you
      can replace it with a more sophisticated one.

   NOTE
      Please see the introductory chapter of this module for
      an explanation of the different possible levels of use
      of the PAL memory allocation routines.

!short: PalRealloc           Replacement for realloc
   NAME
      PalRealloc

   DESCRIPTION
      Reallocates memory like realloc does, but will call the
      out-of-mem handler when it can't allocate the requested
      block.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void *PalRealloc(void *p, size_t size);

   INPUTS
      p    - a pointer to a memory block returned by PalAlloc,
             PalRealloc, PalCalloc or PalStrdup.
      size - the amount of memory (in bytes) to allocate.

   RETURN VALUE
      A pointer to the new block of memory. If the allocation
      fails, PalMalloc will call the PalMemFail function with
      the size of the requested block. The standard PalMemFail
      will simply do a FatalExit, but you can replace it with a
      more sophisticated one.

   NOTE
      See your C compilers documentation for details on how
      realloc works - PalRealloc calls it internally.

!short: PalCalloc            Replacement for calloc
   NAME
      PalCalloc

   DESCRIPTION
      Allocates memory like calloc does, but will call the
      out-of-mem handler when it can't allocate the requested
      block.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void *PalCalloc(size_t n, size_t size);

   INPUTS
      n    - the number of elements to allocate
      size - the size of one element

   RETURN VALUE
      A pointer to the allocated block of memory. If the
      allocation fails, PalCalloc will call the PalMemFail
      function with the size of the requested block. The
      standard PalMemFail will simply do a FatalExit, but you
      can replace it with a more sophisticated one.

   NOTE
      See your C compilers documentation for details on how
      calloc works - PalCalloc calls it internally.

!short: PalFree              Replacement for free
   NAME
      PalFree

   DESCRIPTION
      Frees a block of allocated memory.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void PalFree(void *p);

   INPUTS
      p    - a pointer to a memory block returned by PalAlloc,
             PalRealloc, PalCalloc or PalStrdup.

   RETURN VALUE
      None.

   NOTE
      See your C compilers documentation for details on how
      free works - PalFree calls it internally.

      Please see the introductory chapter of this module for
      an explanation of the different possible levels of use
      of the PAL memory allocation routines. If you use them
      at Level 3, you don't need to care about the double
      pointer - the 'free' replacement macro does this for
      you.

!short: PalStrdup            Replacement for strdup
   NAME
      PalStrdup

   DESCRIPTION
      Duplicates a string like strdup does, but will call the
      out-of-mem handler when it can't allocate the requested
      block. The standard PalMemFail will simply do a FatalExit,
      but you can replace it with a more sophisticated one.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      char *PalStrdup(char *s);

   INPUTS
      s   -  a pointer to a zero-delimited string.

   RETURN VALUE
      A copy of the original string.

   NOTE
      See your C compilers documentation for details on how
      strdup works - PalStrdup calls it internally.

!short: SetPalMemFail        Define your own out of memory handler
   NAME
      SetPalMemFail

   DESCRIPTION
      Use this routine to set your own out of memory handler.
      Pass it the address of your handler function.

      It will return the address of the old handler, in case
      you need to set it back.

      The handler function itself will get the size of the
      block of memory that could not be allocated. It can
      itself try to free up sufficient memory. If it thinks
      it has been successful in doing so, it should return
      TRUE to the caller to trigger another allocation
      attempt. Otherwise, it should either do a FatalExit
      or return FALSE - in this case, the caller of the
      allocation function will get a NULL value return.

      Here's what the default PAL out of memory handler looks
      like:

      int PalMemFail(size_t size)
      {
         FatalExit("PalMemFail: Out of memory !", 99);
         return FALSE; /* not really necessary */
      }

      As you can see, the default handler does not attempt
      to free up memory, it just panicks.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void *SetPalMemFail(int (*NewFun)(size_t size));

   INPUTS
      NewFun - a pointer to your handler. (As a pointer
      to a function that accepts a size_t and returns
      an int).

   RETURN VALUE
      A pointer to the old handler. (As a void *)

   NOTE
      While the standard handler listed above does not return,
      your custom version can do so - see the samples below
      for further details.

   SAMPLES
      void *MyMemFail(size_t size)
      {
         return FALSE;
      }

      /* ... */
      SetPalMemFail(MyMemFail); /* set new out of mem handler */
      /* ... */

      This handler is the 'passthru' version. It doesn't do anything -
      the behaviour is actually the same as if the whole handler
      mechanism wasn't there at all, and the allocation routines would
      return themselves, directly.

      That's not very useful. This version is more interesting:

      int MyMemFail2(size_t size)
      {
         /* static counter: prevent reentrant calls */
         static int CallCount = 0;
         int Success;

         if(CallCount++) FatalExit("MemFail called recursively !", 1);

         /* attempt to free up sufficient memory */
         Success = FreeSomeMemory(size);

         --CallCount;
         if(!Success) FatalExit("Out of memory !", 2);
         return TRUE;
      }

      /* ... */
      SetPalMemFail(MyMemFail2); /* set new out of mem handler */
      /* ... */

      Notice the precaution that is taken against calling the
      handler recursively. This can easily happen if you call a
      function that itself tries another allocation. MsgBox
      would be a good example - since it opens a window and
      saves the background of it, it will call PalMalloc
      somewhere, and you will end up in your handler again,
      recursively. It is recommended that you use this kind of
      device in your own handler as well.

      Also, be sure to return TRUE IF AND ONLY IF your attempt
      to free up some memory succeeded at least partially. If
      there was no progress at all, either do a FatalExit or
      return FALSE. (If you do the latter, be sure that the
      routine that tried to do the allocation handles this
      case.) If you return TRUE without having freed any
      additional memory, you will end up in an endless loop.
