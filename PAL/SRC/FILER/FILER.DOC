^u Filer communications routines

    This set of functions can be used to exchange files between
    a desktop and the palmtop, by using the palmtop's Filer
    application. The user has to launch the Filer on the
    palmtop, and these functions will put the palmtop in Server
    mode and enable file transfers to and from the desktop.
    Once communication has been established, the palmtop
    will be the SERVER (remote), and the computer at the other
    end will be the CLIENT (local). There are also functions
    for creating, reading and deleting remote directories.

Available functions:

  - FilerConnect    : Establish connection with filer.
  - FilerDisconnect : Shut down Filer communications.
  - FilerSendFile   : Send a file to the palmtop.
  - FilerGetFile    : Get a file from the palmtop.
  - FilerDelFile    : Delete a file on the palmtop.
  - FilerMakeDir    : Create a directory on the palmtop.
  - FilerDelDir     : Delete a directory from the palmtop.
  - FilerAskDir     : Request directory info from the palmtop.
  - FilerGetDir     : Get directory entries from the palmtop.
  - FilerSync       : Attempt re-synchronization with filer.


  There is also a possibility to use callback functions to
  open & close a data stream that you wish to send or
  receive from the palmtop, or while a transfer is in progress.
  PAL provides a standard set of callback functions for this,
  but you can easily instruct PAL to use your own set. See the
  FilerCallBack section of this document for more details.

!short: FilerConnect         Initiate filer communications.
   NAME
      FilerConnect

   DESCRIPTION
      This function will initiate filer communications by:

      1- Setting the specified baud-rate to the specified port
         of the client, or attempting to automatically find out
         the baudrate of the server and set the client accordingly
         (if zero is given as a baudrate).

      2- attempt to put the remote side on server mode.

      3- Return a pointer to a FILERCOM structure that will be
         used by the rest of the filer functions.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      FILERCOM *FilerConnect(int PortNumber, unsigned long BaudRate, FLCB *pCb);

   INPUTS
      PortNumber   - The port number (1-4) of the client (local) side.
      BaudRate     - Valid baudrate value (one of the following):
                     115000, 57600, 38400, 19200, 9600, 4800, 2400, 1200.

                     !NOTE: If zero (0) is given as a baudrate, FilerConnect()
                     will attempt to find out the server baudrate by trying
                     out the above baudrates in the order shown above.

      FLCB *pCb    - pointer to a 'callback' function. PAL has a callback
                     function of its own, called "FlCb". You can pass the
                     address of it if you don't want to use a callback
                     function of your own. Example:

                     /* connect at COM2:19200 using PAL's callback function */
                     pFiler = FilerConnect(2,19200, &FlCb);

                     If you wish you can pass the address of one of your
                     own callback functions, so they can display a progress
                     meter, for example. The callback function is only
                     called from FilerSendFile() and FilerGetFile() functions.
                     See the sample below or the Filer Callback functions
                     section for more details.

   RETURN VALUE
      FILERCOM          : pointer to a FILERCOM structure, NULL if
                          communication has failed.

   NOTE
      If the server does not respond, FilerConnect() will timeout and
      return NULL.  During communications, if connection is lost
      momentarily, the client will attempt to re-synchronize (3-times)
      with the server, till timeout occurs. If connection is re-established,
      file transfer continues as if nothing happened, and no data-loss
      will occur. If connection is lost, it is advisable to close down
      communications before attempting to effectuate file transfer
      operations again.

      retreive directory information on the remote side.
      For more details see the FilerGetDir() function.

      Note that you cannot issue other filer commands than
      FilerGetDir in the loop that retrieves filenames. You
      cannot copy files in the same loop, for example - this
      will confuse the FilerGetDir.

      You CANNOT use any other filer functions while retreiving
      directory information, otherwise you will loose sync with
      the remote side. Once you issue a FilerAskDir() command,
      the server expects subsequent FilerGetDir() commands _only_
      till the complete directory information has been transfered.

!short: FilerGetDir          Get remote directory information.
   NAME
      FilerGetDir

   DESCRIPTION
      This function must be used as many number of times as needed to
      get the information of every directory entry from the remote
      side. It is similar to the standard FindNext() function.
      First, FilerAskDir() must be called with the directory name
      to initiate directory transfer, and subsequent calls to
      FilerGetdir() must be made to retreive individual directory
      entries.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int  FilerGetDir(FILERCOM *pFiler);

   INPUTS
      pFiler       - pointer to a FILERCOM communications structure.

   RETURN VALUE
      CANNOT_GET_ENTRY : No more remote directory entries to read.
      GOT_DIR_ENTRY    : Received a valid directory entry from remote.

      The directory information for each entry is returned in the FILERCOM
      structure as follows:

      pFiler->Name           : File/Directory name.
      pFiler->FileSize       : long integer specifying the file size.
      pFiler->Attribute      : integer specifying the file attributes.

      pFiler->DateStamp.sec  : integer specifying the seconds of date-stamp.
      pFiler->DateStamp.min  : integer specifying the minutes of date-stamp.
      pFiler->DateStamp.hour : integer specifying the hour (0-23).
      pFiler->DateStamp.day  : integer specifying the date (1-31).
      pFiler->DateStamp.month: integer specifying the month (1-12).
      pFiler->DateStamp.year : integer specifying the year (add + 1980).

   NOTE
      You must first enable communications with the FilerConnect()
      function, then initiate directory information transfer
      by using the FilerAskDir() function, and finally make
      subsequent calls to FilerGetDir() to get the directory
      information of each directory entry.

      Note that you cannot issue other filer commands than
      FilerGetDir in the loop that retrieves filenames. You
      cannot copy files in the same loop, for example - this
      will confuse the FilerGetDir.

   DESCRIPTION
      This function is not used that often, but it can come in handy
      when the remote side is out of sync for some particular reason.
      This function will attempt to resynchronize without having to
      close down the filer communications.

   INPUTS
      pFiler       - pointer to a FILERCOM communications structure.

   RETURN VALUE
      SERVER_ACK        : Returns always SERVER_ACK.

   NOTE
      Must be already connected (palmtop in server mode) before you
      can use this function.

!short: FilerCallBack        Information about Filer Callback functions.

      The 3rd argument of the FilerConnect() function is used to
      pass the address of an FLCB structure. This can point to the standard
      set of callback functions provided by PAL, or the one of your own:
           
        FILERCOM *FilerConnect(int PortNumber, unsigned long BaudRate,
                               FLCB *pCb);

      There is a set of 6 functions that is used internally by the
      FilerGetFile() and FilerSendFile() routines. They are briefly
      described here to give you an idea on how they work, and to help you
      create your own callback functions for filer communications. These
      functions replace the standard fopen(), fclose(), fread() & fwrite()
      functions. You can  write your own callback functions like the ones
      provided by PAL. Your functions will be called by the FilerGetFile
      and FilerSendFile during:

        a) the opening of a data stream (could be a file, or even a memory
           block),

        b) while a transfer to or from the remote is in progress (for
           displaying a progress meter for example),

        c) and finally when closing a data stream.


      There are 6 standard callback functions that are provided by PAL:

        - StdFlcbSendOpen : Open a local transmission stream for reading
                            access (similar to fopen). Once the stream is
                            opened, StdFlcbSendBlock is used to read the data
                            blocks from the stream (usually a file to be
                            send), so FilerRequest() can transfer them to
                            the remote side.

                            This function is equivalent to:

                               return fopen(FileName, "rb");


        - StdFlcbSendBlock: Get a block of data from a local stream.
                            FilerRequest() can then be used to transfer it
                            to the remote side.

                            This is similar to:

                               return fread(Buf, 1, Size, Handle);


        - StdFlcbSendClose: Close a local transmission stream, same as
                            fclose(Handle).

      
        - StdFlcbRecvOpen : Open a local reception stream, for write access.
                            Once the stream is opened, StdFlcbRecvBlock is used
                            to write a block of data that has been received,
                            to that stream.

                            This function is equivalent to:

                               return fopen(FileName, "wb");


        - StdFlcbRecvBlock: Write a received block of data to a stream.
                            This function is equivalent to:

                               return fwrite(Buf, 1, Size, Handle);

        - StdFlcbSendClose: Close a local transmission stream, same as
                            fclose().



      This is how the above functions are defined in the FLCB structure:

        typedef struct {
           void   *(*FlcbSendOpen)(char *FileName);
           size_t  (*FlcbSendBlock)(void *Buf, size_t Size, void *Handle);
           void    (*FlcbSendClose)(void *Handle);

           void   *(*FlcbRecvOpen)(char *FileName);
           size_t  (*FlcbRecvBlock)(void *Buf, size_t Size, void *Handle);
           void    (*FlcbRecvClose)(void *Handle);
        } FLCB;


      Here's an example of two callback functions replacing StdFlcbSendBlock()
      and StdFlcbReadBlock(). They display dots on the screen while a file
      transfer is in progress:

       /* Our own Send-block routine replacing the standard StdFlcbSendBlock */
        size_t  MySendBlock(void *Buf, size_t Size, void *Handle)
        {
          putchar('.');  /* display a dot on the screen on every block sent  */
          return fread(Buf, 1, Size, Handle);  /* read block from the stream */
        }

       /* Owr own Get-block routine, replacing the standard StdFlcbRecvBlock */
        size_t  MyRecvBlock(void *Buf, size_t Size, void *Handle)
        {
          putchar('.');  /* display a dot on every block received */
          return fwrite(Buf, 1, Size, Handle); /* write a block to the stream   */
        }


        /* our own FLCB structure for our callback get/send functions */
        FLCB MyFlCb;

        /* replace 2 standard callback functions by 2 of our own */
        MyFlCb = FlCb;
        MyFlCb.FlcbSendBlock = MySendBlock;
        MyFlCb.FlcbRecvBlock = MyRecvBlock;


      Finally, you just need to pass the address of your FLCB structure
      to the FilerConnect() function, and your callback functions will
      be used instead of the ones provided by PAL:

        pFiler = FilerConnect(1,19200, &MyFlCb);

      For more details on the callback functions, please take a look at
      the FSAMPLE.C, FILERCB.C, GETFILER.C and SNDFILER.C source files.
