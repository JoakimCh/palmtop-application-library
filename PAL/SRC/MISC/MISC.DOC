!short: AnnuncPos            Set the annunciators position.
   NAME
      AnnuncPos

   DESCRIPTION
      This function places the annunciators (Shift,Caps,Fn indicators) on
      the bottom left or right of the screen. It is useful to place the
      annunciators to the left of the screen in your programs, so they don't
      get over the F1 label on the screen (like in the PIMs).

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void AnnuncPos(int position);

   INPUTS
      position - The position of the annunciators. You can use one of
                 the following values:

                 AN_LEFT : place annunciators to the bottom left,
                 AN_RIGHT: place annunciators to the bottom right.

   RETURN VALUE
      None

   NOTE
      The annunciators are usually to the right side of the screen while
      in DOS, and to the left when in the System Manager PIMs.

   SAMPLE
      AnnuncPos(AN_LEFT);  /* place annunciators to the left side */

!short: Check5f              Check for presence of INT 5Fh services.
   NAME
      Check5f

   DESCRIPTION
      This function checks for the presence of INT 5Fh services
      (Either running on palmtop or on PC with emulator). Returns
      TRUE if services are present.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int  Check5f(void);

   INPUTS
      None

   RETURN VALUE
      TRUE if INT 5Fh services are present.

   NOTE
      You can use the CGAGRAPH.COM or CG.COM emulator to have access
      of the INT 5Fh services on your desktop (286+ only).
      The GraphMode() function includes the Check5f() test.

   SAMPLE
      if(!Check5f()) FatalExit("Init failed - CGAGRAPH not loaded ?", 1);

!short: CheckSysMgr          Check if SysMgr services are available.
   NAME
      CheckSysMgr

   DESCRIPTION
      This function checks if the System manager is loaded.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int CheckSysMgr(void);

   INPUTS
      None.

   RETURN VALUE
      Returns TRUE (1) if SysMgr is loaded, FALSE (0) otherwise.

   NOTE
      Checking for SysMgr presence is mandatory for PAL applications
      that use functions from the SM_SVC module - these will not
      work and even crash without the presence of SysMgr.

   SAMPLE
    if(!CheckSysMgr()) printf("SysMgr not loaded!\n");
    else printf("SysMgr is loaded...\n");

!short: FatalExit            Fatal error exit from PAL and return error code.
   NAME
      FatalExit

   DESCRIPTION
      This function is used to exit the program when a fatal error occurs.
      You can specify the error message to be displayed and the error
      code to be returned to DOS.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void FatalExit(char *Msg, int ExitCode);

   INPUTS
      Msg      - The error message you want to be displayed.
      ExitCode - The error code (number) to be returned to DOS.

   RETURN VALUE
      Returns the error code to DOS and quits program.

   NOTE
      This function automatically resets the screen mode to text
      upon exit.

   SAMPLE

   if(!(pFont = LoadFont("span0015.hfn"))) FatalExit("Load Font failed", 1);

!short: PalInit              Initialize PAL library (first thing to do).
   NAME
      PalInit

   DESCRIPTION
      This function initializes the PAL library. It can optionally
      switch to graphics mode and also sets the 'Palmtop'
      variable to non-zero if running on HP palmtop. This is the
      first function that is usually called in a program using
      the PAL library.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int  PalInit(int Graphics);

   INPUTS
      Graphics - a flag: pass 1 if you want PalInit to switch to
                 graphics mode. (Generally the case)

   RETURN VALUE
      Returns TRUE if successful.

   NOTE
      The opposite function of PalInit() is PalDeInit().

   SAMPLE
   if(!PalInit(1)) FatalExit("PalInit failed.", 1);

!Seealso: FatalExit SetRule SetColor SelectFont PalDeInit

!short: PalDeInit            Shut down PAL library.

   NAME

      called just before exiting the program.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void PalDeInit(int Text);

   INPUTS
      Text  -  a flag: pass 1 if you want PalDeInit to switch
               to text mode for you.

   RETURN VALUE
      None

   NOTE
      This function is the opposite of PalInit().

   SAMPLE
      PalDeInit(1);  /* shut down PAL services, switch to text */

!Seealso: PalInit TextMode

!short: WhichHp              Returns the model number of the palmtop.

   NAME
      WhichHp

   DESCRIPTION

      running upon.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int  WhichHp(void);

   INPUTS
      None

   RETURN VALUE
        0 --> no palmtop, PC
       95 --> HP95LX
      100 --> HP100LX

   SAMPLE
      if(WhichHp() == 0) printf("This is not an HP palmtop!");

!Seealso: Check5f

!short: GetKey               Get a key (with ASCII and Scan code).

   NAME
      GetKey

   DESCRIPTION
      This function will wait for a keystroke and return it in both ASCII
      and scancode. The upper byte of the result will hold the scancode,
      the lower byte the ASCII code. This function can also detect the
      palmtop-specific keys like MENU.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      WORD GetKey(void);

   INPUTS
      None

   RETURN VALUE
      A 16-bit value (WORD) with the most significant byte for the scancode,
      and the least significant byte for the ASCII code.

   NOTE
      This function can work in conjunction with the PushKeys() function
      which allows to push a sequence of Keys which GetKey will deliver.

   SAMPLE
      int key;

      /* Get scancode and ASCII code */
      key = GetKey();  /* wait for a key press */

!Seealso: PushKeys KeyWaiting

!short: KeyWaiting           Returns TRUE if a key is waiting

   NAME
      KeyWaiting

   DESCRIPTION
      Return TRUE if a keystroke is waiting to be retrieved via
      GetKey

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int KeyWaiting(void);

   INPUTS
      None

   RETURN VALUE
      TRUE if a key is waiting, else FALSE.

   NOTE
      This function respects keys pushed with the PushKeys function.
      Using kbhit() will not know about these.

   SAMPLE
      if(KeyWaiting()) break; /* leave loop if user presses a key */

!Seealso: PushKeys GetKey

!short: PushKeys             Push a sequence of Keys which GetKey will deliver.

   NAME
      PushKeys

   DESCRIPTION
      This function is used in conjunction with GetKey() and pushes a
      sequence of keys that GetKey() can deliver.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void PushKeys(WORD *pKeys);

   INPUTS
      pKeys - pointer to a 0-terminated array of WORDs, with the most
              significant byte as scancode and the least significant
              one as ASCII code.

   RETURN VALUE
      None

   NOTE
      This function is using a global int array called KStack[MAX_KEYSTACK]
      which can hold up to MAX_KEYSTACK entries. It is used in recursive
      calls to PushKeys - this way, pushed keystrokes that cause PushKeys
      to be called again when being retrieved by GetKey don't cause a
      problem. Note that the Menu module calls PushKeys itself.

   SAMPLE
      Not available at this moment.

!short: Volume               Set the volume level of the palmtop.

   NAME
      Volume

   DESCRIPTION
      This function sets the volume level of the palmtop.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void Volume(int Level);

   INPUTS
      Level - The volume level, which can be one of the 4 possible
              settings:

                VOL_OFF   : Set volume completely off.
                VOL_LOW   : Set volume to the lowest level.
                VOL_MEDIUM: Set volume to the middle level.
                VOL_HI    : Set volume to the maximum level.

   RETURN VALUE
      None

   NOTE
      The default setting is VOL_HI.

   SAMPLE
      Volume(VOL_HI);  /* set volume to maximum */

!short: SetSerialPort        Turn on/off the serial port of the palmtop.

   NAME
      SetSerialPort

   DESCRIPTION
      This function turns on or off the serial port COM1 (wire) of the
      palmtop.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void SetSerialPort(int Mode);

   INPUTS
      Mode - Can be either SERIAL_ON, or SERIAL_OFF.

   RETURN VALUE
      None

   NOTE
      When the serial port is ON, the palmtop drains the batteries faster.
      Do not forget to turn it off when not in use. The baudrate settings
      are not affected when calling this function. The Infared (I.R.) port
      is not affected either.

   SAMPLE
      SetSerialPort(SERIAL_OFF); /* turn off serial port */

!Seealso: SetLightSleep

!short: SetLightSleep        Enable/disable light-sleep (Power-management).

   NAME
      SetLightSleep

   DESCRIPTION
      This function enables/disables the power-management feature called
      'light-sleep'. This does accelerate the computer's speed somehow,
      but decreases battery life. It is useful to turn it off while doing
      a search for example, to speed-up the search process.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void SetLightSleep(int Mode);

   INPUTS
      Mode - Can be either SLEEP_ON, or SLEEP_OFF.

   RETURN VALUE
      None

   NOTE
      When the light sleep feature is disabled, the battery life is reduced
      dramatically. It is important to remember to turn this feature back ON
      before exiting your program.

   SAMPLE
      SetLightSleep(SLEEP_ON); /* enable light-sleep */

!Seealso: SetSerialPort SetTimeOut

!short: SetTimeOut           Set the timeout delay of the Auto-Power-Off.

   NAME
      SetTimeOut

   DESCRIPTION
      This function will change the time-out delay of the Auto-Shut-Off
      feature of the palmtop.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void SetTimeOut(WORD value);

   INPUTS
      value - A 16-bit value for the time-out delay. The value is actually
              the number of clock ticks (18.2 per second), so a time-out
              delay of ten seconds should be 182.

   RETURN VALUE
      None

   NOTE
      WARNING!!! If the time-out value is too small the palmtop will turn
      off as soon as you turn it on, and only a CTL-ALT-DEL (warm boot)
      will bring it back to normal!

   SAMPLE
      SetTimeOut(2184); /* set timeout to 2 minutes */

!short: MsgBox               Display a message box with buttons
   NAME
      MsgBox

   DESCRIPTION
      MsgBox will display a message window with a title and text that
      you specify, and lets the user select one of up to five buttons
      that you also define. It will return the index of the button that
      the user selected. Optionally, a pointer to an input buffer may
      be passed - the message box will then also have an input field
      where the user can type text. The buffer will contain that text
      when MsgBox returns.

      MsgBox can also display a function key bar at the bottom of
      the screen. This is triggered by embedding function key names
      and optionally labels in the button label strings. See the
      description of the 'Buttons' parameter below for details.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int MsgBox(char *Title, char *Msg, char *Inp, char *Buttons, ...);

   INPUTS
      Title   - a short title string, will be displayed at the top of
                the window. If you don't want a title, use NULL here.

      Msg     - the message that will be displayed inside the message
                window. If you want line breaks, use the '|' character
                to insert them. (See example below). There may be ten
                lines of text at most. You may use printf format
                specifiers in the message. The corresponding parameters
                must be specified _following_ the Buttons argument.

      Inp     - if this pointer is not NULL, it should point to an
                input buffer of at least 80 characters. The message
                box will contain an input field in this case, and the
                input that the user types will end up in that buffer.
                If you pass NULL for this parameter, there will not
                be an input field.

                Note: If Inp is not NULL, the two last lines of the
                Msg string (that is, the two last segments delimited
                by '|') have special meaning. The first one is the
                prompt that will appear before the input field,
                the second one is the initial contents of that field.

      Buttons - the legends to be displayed on the buttons. Separate
                them with a '|' character. (see example below)
                If you don't want buttons, use NULL here. You may
                have a maximum of five buttons. Start the legend of
                a button with '!' if you want it to be the one that
                initially has the focus. If you want your button to
                be associated with a function key (and the labels
                displayed), append [Fn] to your button legend,
                replacing 'n' by the function key number. To e.g.
                assign a button labeled 'Yes' to the F6 key, you would
                use this: " Yes [F6]". You can have an alternate
                text displayed on the key - add a colon and the key
                label that you would like. Sample Buttons string:
                " Integrate [F2:Int]|Differentiate [F3:Dif]".

                Note: If you just want the default function key
                labels displayed, use [F] in any of your button
                labesl.


      ...     - a variable number of parameters - corresponding to
                the printf format specifiers in the Msg string.
                The resulting message may not exceed 1K in length !

   RETURN VALUE
      The index of the selected button (starting at zero for the first
      one), or the predefined constants DN_OK and DN_CANCEL, if the user
      hit F10 or ESC, respectively.

   NOTE
      You may want to pad button labels with blanks for better optics.
      That is, instead of "OK|Cancel" use "  OK  |Cancel" to give both
      buttons the same width.

   SAMPLE
      int r;

      r = MsgBox("Attention", " | Sure delete %s ? | ",
                 NULL, "  OK  |!Cancel", FileName);
      if(r == 0 || r == DN_OK) DeleteFile(FileName);

!short: MsgWin               Display a message window
   NAME
      MsgWin

   DESCRIPTION
      MsgWin will display a message window with a title and text that
      you specify. Unlike MsgBox, MsgWin does not wait for a keystroke,
      it immediately returns, leaving the window on-screen. You can
      close the window and free associated memory by calling MsgWin
      again, specifying a NULL Msg pointer. Intermediate calls with
      a different Msg are OK too - the window will be closed and then
      reopened, displaying the new text.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int MsgWin(char *Title, char *Msg, ...);

   INPUTS
      Title   - a short title string, will be displayed at the top of
                the window. If you don't want a title, use NULL here.

      Msg     - the message that will be displayed inside the message
                window. If you want line breaks, use the '|' character
                to insert them. (See example below). There may be ten
                lines of text at most. You may use printf format
                specifiers in the message. The corresponding parameters
                must be specified following the Msg argument.
                To close the window, call MsgWin again, and specify
                NULL for this parameter.

      ...     - a variable number of parameters - corresponding to
                the printf format specifiers in the Msg string.
                The resulting message may not exceed 1K in length !

   RETURN VALUE

!short: MsDelay              Wait a specified number of milliseconds
   NAME
      MsDelay

   DESCRIPTION
      MsDelay will wait for a specified number of milliseconds.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void MsDelay(unsigned int MilliSecs)

   INPUTS
      MilliSecs - the number of milliseconds to wait.

   NOTE
      Although the waiting period is specified in milliseconds, the
      actual resolution is of an 18th of a second only. Also note that
      since the parameter is an unsigned int, about 65 seconds is
      the longest period that you can wait for.
      Finally, this function will not work if the 18 Hz interrupt
      is disabled.

!short: SetErrorHandler      Set the int 24 handler to be used
   NAME
      SetErrorHandler

   DESCRIPTION
      This function replaces the DOS default errorhandler (DEF_ERRH).
      If an error occurs in a system function DOS will normally
      display the error and asks what to do with it (Abort,
      Retry, Ignore or Fail). If you specify the NOE_ERRH
      handlertype the errorhandler will be replaced by one
      supplied in the PAL library. This errorhandler will suppress
      any DOS message. It acts as if the user selected 'fail' or
      'ignore'. The function that was called will returned with
      a corresponding error indication - your program should check
      for this.


   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int SetErrorHandler(int HandlerType);

   INPUTS
      HandlerType - The handler to be used. You can use one of the
                    following values:

                    DEF_ERRH : The default errorhandler from DOS.
                    NOE_ERRH : No errors errorhandler.

   RETURN VALUE
      This function will always return 0 if one of the defined
      handlers is used. If an unknown handler type is used it will
      return 1.

   NOTE
      To work safe use it only when you use some system function
      like access to disk. After the function is executed turn
      the DEF_ERRH on. This way the DOS errors will be displayed
      in places you did not check if anything could go wrong. It
      is not necessary to switch back to DEF_ERRH before
      quitting your program. If an program ends DOS will turn
      the default errorhandler on itself.

   SAMPLE
      int file_exist;

      SetErrorHandler(NOE_ERRH);
      file_exist = access("a:\\test.xyz", 0);       /* check if file exist */
      SetErrorHandler(DEF_ERRH);
      if (file_exist != 0 ) printf("File does not exist or no disk in drive\n");

!short:  SerialCtl           Toggle SysMgr serial port interference
   NAME
      SerialCtl

   DESCRIPTION
      SerialCtl will disable/enable SysMgr serial port interference.
      DOS applications that do serial port I/O cannot run correctly
      under SysMgr unless they are installed with task-switching
      disabled in the application manager. SerialCtl will switch
      off SysMgr interference, while maintaining switchability.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      int SerialCtl(int State);

   INPUTS
      int State         Whether to disable interference or not.
                        a 1 will disable interference, a 0 will
                        enable it again.

   RETURNS
      TRUE if SysMgr is not running or if action could be
      performed, FALSE otherwise

   NOTE
      SerialCtl writes to an undocumented SysMgr control
      variable to do its thing. Since this variable is not
      at the same location in the various ROM releases, it
      uses some heuristics to find it. It tries to make sure
      that it writes to the right location - if this routine
      returns FALSE to indicate that it did not succeed, it
      is probably not compatible with your ROM release. Some
      TSRs that hook interrupt 1C may also keep it from
      working.

   SAMPLE
     SerialCtl(1); /* turn interference off */
     SerialTransfer();
     SerialCtl(0); /* allow interference again */
