   NAME
      OpenWin

   DESCRIPTION
      OpenWin opens a window at a certain screen position, with
      a size, border style and title you specify.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      PALWIN *OpenWin(WORD Style, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2,
                      char *Caption);

   INPUTS
      Style   - see the entry on window styles below.
      x1      - x position of upper left corner (including frame)
      y1      - y position of upper left corner (including frame)
      x2      - x position of lower right corner, including frame
                but not shadow.
      y2      - y position of lower right corner, including frame
                but not shadow.
      Caption - The title for your window - use NULL if you
                don't want a title.

   RETURN VALUE
      OpenWin returns a pointer to a PALWIN structure (described
      in another entry) or NULL on failure.

   SAMPLE
      PALWIN *pWin;

      pWin = OpenWin(WS_HP200, 10, 10, 100, 100, " Hello PAL ");

   NAME
      CloseWin

   DESCRIPTION
      Closes a window opened by OpenWin.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      void CloseWin(PALWIN *pWin);

   INPUTS
      pWin - the pointer to the PALWIN structure returned by
      OpenWin

   NOTE
      CloseWin will only restore the background of the window if
      it got opened with the WS_SAVEBG style.

   SAMPLE
      PALWIN *pWin;

      pWin = OpenWin(WS_HP200, 10, 10, 100, 100, " Hello PAL ");

!short: WinText              Output text in a window
   NAME
      WinText

   DESCRIPTION
      Output a text string at position (x,y) in client area of a window
      given by a pointer to a PALWIN descriptor. The currently selected

                  OpenWin

      OffsetX   - X coordinate where text should appear - relative to the
                  upper left corner of the window, not the screen.

      OffsetY   - Y coordinate where text should appear - relative to the
                  upper left corner of the window, not the screen.

      Txt       - the text to be output.

   SAMPLE
      PALWIN *pWin;

      pWin = OpenWin(WS_HP200, 10, 10, 100, 100, " Hello PAL ");
      WinText(pWin, 5, 5, "WinText test");
      GetKey();
      CloseWin(pWin);

!short: PALWIN Structure     Records information on a window
   The PALWIN Structure

   The window functions keep track of information on a window in
   the PALWIN structure. Here's its definition from PAL.H:

    /* the window descriptor structure */
    typedef struct {
       void *Buffer;        /* background storage */
       WORD Style;          /* Style that window has */
       WORD Font;           /* System font to use for caption & menues     */
       int  x1, y1, x2, y2; /* physical dimensions of window, INCL. border */
       int  PosX, PosY;     /* upper left coordinates of client area       */
       int  Width, Depth;   /* width and depth of client area              */
    } PALWIN;

    Buffer: This is a pointer to the background of the window,
            in IMG format. It is valid only if the window was
            opened with the WS_SAVEBG style flag, and will be
            used by CloseWin to restore the background. CloseWin
            then frees the memory used by that buffer.

    Style:  The style word as passed to OpenWin.

    Font:   The font to be used for the caption. Currently
            either SMALL_FONT or MEDIUM_FONT, depending on
            inclusion of the WS_SMLFONT style flag.

    x1, y1,
    x2, y2: Coordinates of the upper left and lower right window
            corners, respectively. Stored here as passed to
            OpenWin. Note that the area defined by these
            coordinates includes an eventual caption bar and
            border, but not the shadow.

    PosX,
    PosY:   Absolute screen coordinates of the first 'client
            area' pixel in the window, that is, the first
            upper left corner pixel inside the border and below
            the caption bar.

    Width,
    Depth:  Useable size of the window, that is, the 'inside'
            window space. The coordinates of the last bottom
            right pixel still inside the window but not yet part
            of an eventual border would thus be:
            (PosX+Width-1, PosY+Depth-1).

!short: Window Styles        Control aspect of a window
   Window Styles

   You can either use one of the predefined styles (recommended)
   for a window that you open, or create your own style. Let's
   have a look at the available predefined styles first:

      WS_MENU  : Style used for menues - 1 pixel border and shadow.
      WS_HP100 : same as WS_MENU, but smaller font used
      WS_HP200 : same as WS_MENU, but double border
      WS_HELP  : small font, large border.

   You can also create your own style by 'oring' together the
   following components:

      + Border thickness: either none (for no border), or one of
        the following:

        WS_BORDER  : single pixel border
        WS_DBORDER : double border (2 pixels)
        WS_FRAME   : help frame border (13 pixels)

        Alternatively, simply provide the thickness you want,
        up to 15 pixels.

      + Shadow: 'Or' your style with WS_SHADOW to get a shadow.

      + Small font: 'Or' your style with WS_SMLFONT to have
        SMALL_FONT be used for the caption instead of
        MEDIUM_FONT.

      + Background handling: 'Or' your style with WS_SAVEBG to
        have OpenWin save the background before opening your
        window. You are very likely to want this behaviour - all
        predefined styles have it. Omit it it you want to save
        the memory required, and have other means of restoring
        the background after closing the window.

   SAMPLE
      Here are the definitions of the predefined styles from
      PAL.H:

      #define WS_MENU  (WS_BORDER|WS_SHADOW|WS_SAVEBG)
      #define WS_HP100 (WS_BORDER|WS_SHADOW|WS_SMLFONT|WS_SAVEBG)
      #define WS_HP200 (WS_DBORDER|WS_SHADOW|WS_SAVEBG)
      #define WS_HELP  (WS_FRAME|WS_SMLFONT|WS_SAVEBG)

      For a window with a 7 pixel border, no shadow and a small
      font, you could use:

      #define MY_STYLE (7 | WS_SMLFONT | WS_SAVEBG)

   NOTE
      The first four bits of the style are the border size -
      this makes it easy to just 'or' in the size as shown in
      the sample above.
      Note that you cannot exceed 15 pixels border size. Don't
      forget to include WS_SAVEBG unless you are sure that you
      don't need it.
