PDE Vr.1.2 [DEC-5/95].
----------------------
 + Fixed bug when saving a dialog having "OTHER" types of items.
   PDE now asks for a handler name when an "other" item type is
   selected.

 + ListBox support was added.

 + Updated Help screen.

 + NOTE: For precision item movement (on the desktop) use the
         keypad arrows, and for sizing the PAGEUP/PAGEDN &
         HOME/END key combinations. [Updated in the DOCs & help screen].


PDE Vr.1.10 [04/16/95].
-----------------------
 + There is a bug fixed in the Pickdlg() function of PDEUI.C.
   PDE wouldn't load a dialog resource file when using
   the pick-list.

 + When F3 (EDIT) is pressed, the last edited item has the
   focus instead of the first one.

 + In addition to the TAB key, you can now use SHIFT-TAB to
   select the previous item.

 + When you load a dialog resource file that has only one
   dialog, the pick-list isn't displayed anymore, and the
   dialog is instantly loaded.

 + The TESTDLG.C file won't display a pick-list if there is
   only one dialog to test.

 + You can now sort the dialog items. When the items are
   sorted, the focus order of the dialog items in the dialog
   will be from top to bottom, left to right.

 + PDE now allows NULL pointers to Bitmap types.

 + You can manually set the focus order of every item in
   the dialog.

 + PDE now removes any unnecessary empty lines from the
   resource files.

 + The UP and DOWN arrows have been swapped when sizing the
   dialog window (more natural this way).

 + Added support for dialog hotkeys.

 + Added hotkeys in all the PDE dialogs.
