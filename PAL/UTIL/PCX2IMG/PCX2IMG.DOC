^u PCX2IMG: Convert B&W PCX files into IMG files

   PCX2IMG can convert a black and white PCX file into the
   native HP100/200LX 'IMG' format. To use it, run PCX2IMG and
   give the name of the file to be converted, including the .PCX
   extension.

   Example: To convert MYPICT.PCX, you would enter

      PCX2IMG MYPICT.PCX

   If PCX2IMG is successful, it will briefly display the
   converted file, and store it under the .IMG extension, i.e.
   MYPICT.IMG in this case.

   You can then use the PAL LoadImg() function to load your
   picture, and PutImg() to display it. LoadImg() is much faster
   than LoadPcx().

   Quick Tip: If your PCX file is 44x32 in size (44 pixels wide
   and 32 pixel high), you can rename the resulting .IMG file to
   .ICN, and use as an icon, for example for application manager
   installation. Icons actually are files in .IMG format, but
   with a constant size.
