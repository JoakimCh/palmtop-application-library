To convert the PAL docs to HTML enter DO_HTML on the command
line in this directory. This will first build the NG2HTML utility,
and then use it to generate a number of .HTM files, one for each
source file plus the following files that are entry points:

  OVER.HTM      -   PAL overview
  PAL.HTM       -   PAL reference


NG2HTML takes a set of Norton Guide sources and compiles them to
a set of HTML documents. NG2HTML is called as follows:

  NG2HTML <filelist> <output file> <title>

e.g.:

  NG2HTML PAL.LST PAL.HTM "PAL - Palmtop Application Library"

<filelist> is a file containing all file names of the NG sources you want
to have included in the HTML file. <output file> is the name of the main
file that you can use as entry point. <title> is the title to be put into
the main file.
