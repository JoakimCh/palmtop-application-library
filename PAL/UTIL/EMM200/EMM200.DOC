EMM200.EXE is an Expanded Memory Management driver written by
Hiroyuki Sekiya. It emulates expanded memory by using a paging
file on drive C:, The mapping mechanism of the HORNET chip in
the palmtop is very similar to hardware EMS, so the performance
of this driver is acceptable. Version 2.0 of EMM200 is needed to
use the EMS-PAL functions.

EMM200 was written only for the palmtop, and emulates the EMS
4.0 standard. If your desktop has expanded memory, you can also
test any PAL application that is using EMS on the desktop.
You do not need, nor will you be able to, install EMM200 on
the desktop. Use any plain vanilla EMS emulator (like EMM386)
to do so.

The EMM200 files included with PAL are a minimal subset, to keep
the archive size down. The full version is available in the
HPHAND forum on CompuServe (GO HPHAND) and via FTP - I've seen
it at: ftp://ftp.cc.monash.edu.au/pub/palmtop



                  EMM200 Installation:
                  --------------------

 Since EMM200 keeps its EMS paging area on the C: drive of the
palmtop, you should backup the palmtop's C: drive before
installing the driver on it.

 There are two files needed during installation:

 MAKEEMS.EXE : This program reserves the specified amount of
               Expanded Memory pages needed, on the C: drive
               of the palmtop. It creates a contiguous paging
               file on the root of the C: drive.

 EMM200.EXE  : The EMS driver.


 First you should run MAKEEMS.EXE to create the EMS paging file.
If you don't have enough contiguous space for the EMS file,
you should run a disk defragmentation program, such as DEFRAG.

 The command line for MAKEEMS.EXE is as follows:

 MAKEEMS n

where n is the number of desired pages. Each page is 16384 bytes
of RAM. To create a 128k paging file, you should type:

 MAKEEMS 8

 A prompt will appear with a few weird characters on the screen.
(The screen output is in japanese). Just type 'Y' <enter> and
MAKEEMS will create the paging file. You should immediatly
run chkdsk c: to confirm that everything is ok.

 An EMM200.DAT file should now be in the root of the drive C:.
Use the ATTRIB command to change its attribute to 'system'.
This will prevent you from accidentally erasing the file (which
could be disastrous) and at the same time will keep DEFRAG
utilities from moving it around:

 attrib +s c:\emm200.dat

 The file will now be hidden & protected. The second procedure
of this installation is to add the following line to the
config.sys file:

 device=<path>emm200.exe c:\emm200.dat

where <path> is the path where EMM200.EXE resides. Be sure to
add this line before any other driver that will be using the
Expanded Memory. And finally, reboot the palmtop and confirm
the installed Expanded Memory by using an utility such as MEM.


                      *** CAUTION ***

 If you decide to delete the EMM200.DAT file, be sure to *first*
remove the device=emm200.exe line from the CONFIG.SYS file, and
reboot the computer. Only then you should delete the paging file.
Failing to do so, may corrupt the C: drive.



                      EMM200 REFERENCE:

 1. Options.
 -----------

  DEVICE=EMM200.EXE <file> [-Fn] [-Hn] [-Q]

  <file> : the name of EMS paging file. There is no default for
         : this option, you must specify one.
  -Fn    : The number of physical pages. n=1,2,..,8 The default
         : value for n is 4.

  -Hn    : The number of EMS handles that are opened simultaneously.
           n=2,3,..,255 The default value for n is 16. An increment
           of n requires 20 bytes of conventional memory.

  -Q     : Quiet mode (no display output).



 2.Error messages:
