HV is a HTML viewer for the HP100LX/200LX palmtop computers.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the format used for the
hypertext documents on WWW (the World Wide Web). There are
many Gigabytes of valuable information available in HTML format.
This information is now accessible from the palmtops.

In version 1.1 of HV you still have to download any documents
to your HP before you can browse through them. Future versions
of HV might directly access WWW documents on the Internet.

HV was written using the PAL palmtop library - thanks to the PAL
contributors for providing that great toolbox.
