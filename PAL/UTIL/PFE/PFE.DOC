         PFE, The PAL Font Editor. Vr.1.02 [06/15/95]
         ============================================


 PFE is a small font editor which supports character sets
from 4x4 to 16x16 bits of size. PFE can load any .HFN, .VFN,
or FCL font file, and save it in any of these 3 formats:

 - HFN: PAL's (Palmtop Application Library) horizontal fonts.
 - VFN: Gilles Kohl's VR (Vertical reader) vertical fonts.
 - FCL: FCL definition file, ready to be compiled by
        Gilles Kohl's FCL font compiler/loader.


 * VR and FCL are copyrighted shareware programs written
   by Gilles Kohl.


______________
1. Running PFE

 When you invoke PFE from the command line without any
arguments, PFE will display its internal font. You can
specify the font filename at the command line if you
wish as follows:

 pfe <FontName>

where <FontName> is the filename of a valid .HFN, .VFN or
.FCL font file. When no extension is given, PFE looks for
the .HFN extension. If the specified filename is not
found, the internal (resident) font will be displayed.

 PFE can also load .FCL files for editing. However, there are
a few limitations when loading FCL files in PFE. First,
PFE will ignore any duplicated character definitions in
the FCL file, even if the font size is different. This means
that the FCL file must have character definitions for one
font size only, since PFE can edit only one font at a time.

 What you can do when you have an FCL file with different
font definitions is to split it up into one file per font.
You can use FCL's 'include' command in one of the font
files if you want to compile everything in a single .COM
See your FCL.DOC for more details.

2. Moving around

 Once you have loaded a font in PFE, you will notice the
following on the screen:

 First, on your left is the Edit window grid. It's inside
that grid that character bitmaps can be edited. On your
right the complete character set of the loaded font is
displayed. On the middle top of the screen you will find
the current ASCII code and display of the selected
character on the set, and the character size. On the top
right the filename of the font will be displayed.

 You can press [F1] to get a quick help view of the most
used options.


 a) Character selection:
 -----------------------
 You can select the character to be edited by using the 4
arrows. A small cursor will guide you through the set, and
the grid will display the bitmap of the selected character.
If the cursor falls on an undefined character bitmap, the
sizing rectangle won't appear on the grid.


 You can also select a character by pressing the actual
key on the keyboard. For example, pressing 'a' will
bring the cursor to the character 'a'. If you press
SHIFT-A, the cursor will fall on the 'A' character.
Same goes for numbers, and any other character on the
keyboard.

 Another alternative for selecting characters is using
the ALT-MENU key combination. By holding down both ALT
and MENU keys, you can enter the ASCII code of the
desired character on the numeric keypad, release the
buttons, and the cursor will go to the selected character.


 b) New Font [F2]:
 -----------------

 Pressing F2 will delete the current font from memory and
 clean up the font area. You will be prompted to enter the
 new font size.


 c) Edit character [F3] or [ENTER]:
 ----------------------------------
 This brings you to the Edit mode (See section 3 below).


 d) Set font global size [F4]:
 -----------------------------
 Use this option  if you wish to change the size of all
 the characters in the loaded font. Note that reducing
 the size to smaller than the character's size, the
 characters will be truncated.

 If you enter 0 as a width or height value, the original
 width or height of each character will be preserved.
 This is usefull if you are working with proportional
 fonts.


 e) Copy [F5] & Paste [F6]:
 --------------------------
 You can copy any selected character of the set in the buffer
 by pressing F5 (Copy). You can later use the Paste function
 (F6) to paste the buffer on any other selected character.


 f) Convert from ISO latin to IBM code page 850 [F7]:
 ----------------------------------------------------
 Use this option if you wish to convert some fonts from
 ISO Latin to IBM code page 850. Once the font is converted
 with this option, it can't be converted back.


 g) Rotate complete font [F8]:
 -----------------------------
 This function allows you to rotate all the characters
 of the loaded font. Every time you press it, the characters
 will be rotated 90 degrees clockwise.


 h) Open a font file [F9]:
 -------------------------
 This option will allow you to load a font in PFE. You must
 specify extensions (.HFN, .VFN or .FCL). If no extension is
 given, PFE will default to .HFN


 i) Save the font [F10]:
 -----------------------
 Once you have finished editing the loaded font, use this
 option to save it. PFE will prompt you to enter the filename,
 the font I.D. number (depending on the font style) and
 to select the format output, HFN, VFN or FCL.


 j) Delete character from font [DEL]:
 ------------------------------------
 You can remove any character from the font by pressing the
 DELETE button. The selected character will be completely
 removed from the font.


 k) Quitting PFE [ESC] or [MENU-Q]:
 ----------------------------------
 Before quitting you will be asked if you wish to save the
 current font.

3. Editing a character [F3] or [ENTER]

 Once you have selected the character you wish to edit, press
F3 (Edit-mode). The cursor will now appear inside the grid.
Again, you can move around the grid using the arrows, and draw
using the SPACE-BAR. The drawn character will also appear
in real size on the right of the screen inside the set.


 a) Rotate character [F1]:
 -------------------------
 This simply rotates the selected character 90 degrees clockwise
 every time F1 is pressed.


 b) Invert character [F2]:
 -------------------------
 This function will invert all pixels of the selected character,
 and produce a 'negative image' of it. Note that only the bits
 inside the sizing rectangle will be inverted.


 c) Adjust Width [F3]/[Shift-F3]:
 --------------------------------
 You can adjust the logical width of each character by pressing
 F3 / Shift-F3 till you get the desired width.


 d) Adjust Height [F4]/[Shift-F4]:
 ---------------------------------
 You can adjust the logical height of each character by pressing
 F4 / Shift-F4 till you get the desired height.

 e) Scroll Left [F5]:
 --------------------
 Scrolls the character inside the sizing rectangle to the left.
 Note that the limits of the scrolling area are defined
 by the sizing rectangle.

 f) Scroll Right [F6]:
 --------------------
 Scrolls the character inside the sizing rectangle to the right.


 g) Scroll Up [F7]:
 ------------------
 Scrolls the character inside the sizing rectangle upwards.


 h) Scroll Down [F8]:
 --------------------
 Scrolls the character inside the sizing rectangle downwards.


 i) Restore character [F9]:
 --------------------------
 Restores the character definition the way it was before
 entering the Edit-Mode (undo).


 j) Exit Edit mode [F10] or [ENTER]:
 -----------------------------------
 Pressing F10 will save the current definition in the font
 and exit Edit-mode. You must press F10 again to save the
 font to the file.


 k) Clear character bitmap [DEL]:
 --------------------------------
 Clears the character definition area (all white).

4. Saving a font.

 When you exit the Edit-mode, you can then save your font
to a file, by pressing [F10]. PFE will prompt you for
the filename, font I.D. number (depending on the font style)
and the file format you wish your file to be saved in.
Currently, there are 3 file formats, HFN for horizontal
fonts, VFN for vertical fonts, and FCL definition file
for the FCL font compiler/loader. There's no need to
specify an extension, PFE will add the required extensions
depending on the selected file format.



                         ******



IMPORTANT NOTES:

* When saving to .VFN format, the font must not be rotated
  in PFE. PFE will automatically rotate & flip it for you.
  Note that VR (.VFN) fonts are always 8 or 16 bits of
  height.

* PFE will 'fill-in' undefined characters that fall within
  the ASCII minimum and ASCII maximum range of any HFN
  or VFN font. Only FCL fonts make exception of this.

* When saving a font in .FCL format, font characters that
  exceed 12 bits of height will be truncated. This is
  because the maximum allowable height in FCL definitions
  is 12 (16x12 size).


* Here's a suggestion for the 16-bit font I.D. (style)
  numbers. You can enter any number as an I.D., but it's
  better to enter something more meaningfull like this:


             BIT  DESCRIPTION
             --------------------------------
             15 : Proportional flag (1=prop.)
             14 : Bold flag.
             13 : Italic flag.
             12 : Underlined flag.
             11 : Reverse (negative) flag.
             10 : Special flag.

             9,8: Unused for the moment.

             7-0: Font type ID.

 * For normal text all the bits 8-15 are cleared.

 The bits 0-7 can describe the type of font which can be one of the
 following:

             0 =  ?
             1 = Courier.
             2 = Roman.
             3 = Sans Serif.
             4 = Prestige.
             5 = Script.
             6 = Orator.
             . =  ?
             . =  ?
             . =  ?
           255 = Special.
