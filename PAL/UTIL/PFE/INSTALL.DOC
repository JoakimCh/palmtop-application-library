To create PFE.EXE, first make sure that you have PM (PalMake)
installed as described in .\UTIL\PM\PM.DOC, and that you have
built the PAL library for your compiler. Then, change to the PFE
directory (.\UTIL\PFE) and enter PM [RETURN]. Finally, move the
resulting PFE.EXE to a place in your search path so that you can
call it from everywhere.

MIX compiler users: PFE must be compiled in medium model with the
MIX Power C compiler. To do this, you'll need to create a medium
model PAL library for the MIX compiler first. Edit your PM.CFG
file, and change the 'Model=s' line in the [.c] section to
'Model=m'.

Change to the PAL .\SRC directory, and do a cleanup pass by
entering

  PM C [RETURN]

Then, build the large model PCMPAL.MIX by entering

  PM [RETURN]

Finally, change to the .\UTIL\PFE directory, and again enter

  PM [RETURN]

there to build PFE in medium model.
