This is a sample template for documentation for a given module. It should
be named <module>.doc and reside in the subdirectory of the module.

At this place, provide a general introduction that presents the purpose
of the module, explains the general concepts and data structures
involved (if any), and gives a summary of the functions
available. Not much formal constraints here.

Then follow the descriptions of the various functions.

!short: SampleFunction          Short description of function
   NAME
      SampleFunction

   DESCRIPTION
      Short description of function. This is only an example.

   SYNOPSIS
      #include "pal.h"
      char *SampleFunction(int SampleParameter);

   INPUTS
      SampleParameter - an int with no particular purpose

   RETURN VALUE
      Describe the returned parameter here - don't forget to
      mention error returns.
      If a function has no return values, leave this section out
      altogether. Same goes for 'INPUTS' with a function that
      has no parameters.

   NOTE
      If there is anything special to say, say it here. (Known bugs,
      special cases, etc.). Else, leave this section out altogether.
      Don't leave it there empty.

   SAMPLE
      char *String;

      /* call the sample function, save pointer returned */
      String = SampleFunction(42);
